============

Number theory is a fascinating subject of mathematics. It's definitely accesible because it deals with things we use on a regular basis - the integers - and it is also rigorous.

Plus, it's used in cryptography.

These "illustrations" will be updated and expanded from time to time. If you stumble upon my code and somehow use it to do something awesome, shoot me an email and let me know!
